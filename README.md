# Cell types associated with human brain functional connectomes and their implications in psychiatric diseases
The human whole-brain single-cell data used in this study were obtained from https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/283d65eb-dd53-496d-adb7-7570c7caa443 (Siletti K, et al). The data were further processed using the script preprocess_cortical_seuratdata.R, resulting in the retention of 151 cell clusters from the expression profiles of 1,033,759 cells for analysis.

## Code
Included are the codes necessary to replicate the analyses.

## Code
Included are the proportion of different cell clusters in various brain regions (cluster_density_df.csv), strength of resting-state functional networks at different cut off (degree_centrality.csv) and pseudobulk data of different cell clusters in  cortical regions (cluster_pseudobulk)
